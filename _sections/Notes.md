    Notes on Polish Uprising Seminar

Reading Ferrie's 1994 paper on Immigrant Wealth Accumulation informs me of an extensive American census of immigrant ships between 1840 to 1870.
Furthermore, the exact same method used in the article can be used to study the patterns of Polish immigrants after the '63 uprising, perhaps.

American Reactions to the Polish Insurrection of 1863
Author(s): Joseph Wieczerzak
Source: Polish American Studies, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Jul. - Dec., 1965), pp. 90-98

> Much was added to the legacy over three decades before when, at the time of the Polish November Insurrection, a wave of Polonophilia swept over Jacksonian America; when hardly a day went by without some sympathetic mention of Poland in newspaper editorials; when banners for the Polish insurgents were dedicated in Boston, Polish dances were taught in New York dancing schools, a plethora of amateur verse on Polish themes found its way into print, and public protest meetings and collections were undertaken throughout the country.

Brief History
From its beginnings, Polish identity has been ingrained within the mission and activities of Polish Falcons of America.

For hundreds of years, Poland was a major European economic, political powerhouse and the largest country in Europe. Seen as a threat to the neighboring authoritarian empires of Russia, Prussia and Austria, in the late 1700s Poland was invaded, its vast territory divided and its culture and language suppressed.  This foreign occupation was brutal, lasting over 120 years, and resulted in a series of unsuccessful insurrections against this foreign oppression.

The modern Falcon organization is a direct descendent of a similar organization established in Poland four years after the unsuccessful January Uprising of 1863 against Czarist Russia.   Devoted to physical fitness and physical education, the Polish Falcons adopted the Latin maxim "mens sana in corpore sano," or in Polish, ‚Äúw Zdrowym Ciele, Zdrowy Duch" - "A Healthy Spirit in a Healthy Body." Such efforts were intended to ‚Äúregenerate‚Äù the Polish nation through disciplined physical fitness, preparing the nation for eventual independence. In this spirit, the first Falcon Nest, or lodge, in the United States was organized by Felix L. Pietrowicz in Chicago, Ill. in 1887.   In 1912, the organization‚Äôs headquarters were moved to Pittsburgh, which is centrally located between the two largest centers of Polish-American communities, New York and Chicago.  These American Falcons adopted as their patron the Polish Patriot, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who fought for both the independence of Poland and the United States.

The vision of a resurrected, free Poland was close to the hearts of the early Falcon organization, which became a leader among Polish-American groups in working toward this goal.  By 1917, over 25,000 young Polish-American men were trained by the Polish Falcons to serve in a proposed Polish military force.  During World War I, these Falcon-trained troops became the core of the Polish-American expeditionary force in France and the eventual nucleus of the Polish Army.  At the Polish Falcons Convention held in Pittsburgh on April 3, 1917, the renowned pianist and future premier of newly independent Poland, Ignacy Paderewski, delivered a rousing speech that sparked the recruitment of a Polish Army in the United States to fight for the Western Allies against Germany.  Over 35,000 Polish-American men enlisted in the Allied war effort.   In particular, these Falcon trained troops fought in the famous ‚ÄúBlue Army‚Äù under the leadership of General Jozef Haller. When Poland regained its independence in 1918, these troops helped to form the nucleus of the young country‚Äôs armed forces as neighboring countries immediately attacked Poland, including the fierce Bolshevik Red Army that was planning on spreading communism into Europe by invading Poland.

Once Polish independence was secured, the Polish Falcons of America could turn its attention to improving the lives of its Members. The early part of the 20th century was a time when few social services were available and working conditions, particularly for Polish immigrants, were particularly harsh.  There were no public health and recreation programs, no social security or retirement benefits, and conditions in the work place were often dangerous.  Immigrant men were forced to work extremely long hours for little pay, under difficult and often life-threatening conditions.  If the head of the house died in an industrial accident or was incapacitated, the surviving family often faced impoverishment.  Polish Falcons of America addressed these problems by offering life insurance programs for the Polish-American community at reasonable cost. The Falcons also offered recreational activities for Falcon youth in areas where no other such services were available.  And, combined with these and other programs, the Falcons remained loyal to their commitment to the Polish heritage.

   (Such as that of Kondratii Selivanov - which has nothing to do with my subject - as was shown by Ori in his Referat on the Skoptzy)

Idea:
  Create an Internet Archive collection of related works

  In general - create a sort of point of entry for further research and analysis of primary resources relating to the topic -
      Preset quarries

# The whites:
  The aristocratic Conservatives were centred in the Hotel Lambert in Paris with Prince Adam Czartoryski as their leader. They established a quasi-government-in-exile.

# The Reds:
  The Polish Radicals espoused democratic, republican and sometimes socialistic ideas. Their National Committee, established in Paris and later moved to Brussels, purported to represent the Polish nation, and had as its key figure the historian Joachim Lewelel
