4. Some methodological obstacles

    - Finding data!
      - Scheduled talk with Dr. Michał Połczyński

    - Census data didn't generally record the Polish nationality, especially before the ninth census of 1870.
        - A possible solution might be to use the Castle Garden (The main immigration gate before Ellis Island opened in 1892) records of names, triangulated with ship records.
        This method, developed by the economic historian Dr. Yannay Spitzer to identify Jewish immigrants, which were usually not recorded as such, utilises Soundex - a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English.

        Know Whence You Came: classifying immigrant origins in large-scale textual microdata

5. Some possible research directions
    - The Polish press in the US/UK
        - Networks
        - Temporal and spatial corpus analysis
        - Sentiment and topic modelling
    - Polish-American associations and societies
        - Mapping and networking, spatially and temporally
        - In comparison with different immigrant societies, such as the Jewish
    - American newspaper opinion on the Polish immigration and/or Polish events.
      - Can be geo-referenced and juxtaposed with different waves of immigration and their different characteristics.


### Specific case:

The American newspaper opinion on the January uprising, in lieu of the ongoing civil war and the Russian-Union relations.
- Can be temporally situated as well.
- The Polish-American relations and the imagined other
- The Polish émigrés attitude towards the civil war


- Demonstration of something - HGIS? Plotly eye candy?
